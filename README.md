# Restaurant-Recommendation-System
Welcome to the Restaurant Recommendation System! This project aims to provide users with a convenient way to explore and discover restaurants based on their preferences. To get started, you'll need two main files: restaurant_recommendation_system.py and restaurants.json.

1. restaurant_recommendation_system.py:
This is the main code file of the project. You can run this Python script from your command line interface. It offers a simple and intuitive menu-driven interface for interacting with the recommendation system. Upon running the script, you'll be presented with options to search for restaurants by category or to autocomplete categories based on your input. The script reads data from the restaurants.json file to provide recommendations.

2. restaurants.json:
This JSON file contains a list of restaurants along with their categories and ratings. You'll find multiple restaurants listed under various categories such as Italian, Mexican, Indian, and more. This file serves as the data source for the recommendation system. Feel free to modify or expand this file with additional restaurants or categories to enhance the recommendation experience.

To use the Restaurant Recommendation System:

Ensure both restaurant_recommendation_system.py and restaurants.json are in the same directory.
Run the restaurant_recommendation_system.py script from your command line interface.
Follow the prompts to search for restaurants by category or to autocomplete categories based on your input.
Your feedback is greatly appreciated! If you have any suggestions or encounter any issues while using the system, please feel free to share your experience.
